This C++ code is designed to check whether a given number is a "special number." A special number is defined here as a number that can be expressed as the sum of consecutive positive integers starting from 1. For example, numbers like 1, 3 (1 + 2), 6 (1 + 2 + 3), etc., are considered special.

How the code works:
Input: The user is asked to input a number x.
Recursive function (calSpecial):
The function calSpecial takes three arguments:
val (the number to check),
counter (starts at 1 and increases on each recursive call),
sum (keeps track of the running sum of numbers starting from 1).
The goal of the function is to sum consecutive numbers starting from 1 (1 + 2 + 3 + ...) and compare this sum to val.
If the running sum equals val at any point, the program prints "Special number" and shows how the number is formed by consecutive numbers.
If the sum exceeds val, the function concludes that val is not a special number and terminates the recursion.
If neither condition is met, the function adds the next consecutive number to the sum and recursively calls itself to continue checking.
Output:
If val is a special number, the program prints "Special number" along with the sequence of consecutive integers that sum up to val.
If val is not a special number, it prints "Not a special number."
Example:
For input x = 6, the output would be:

Special number
1 + 2 + 3 + 
For input x = 5, the output would be:

Not a special number.
