Overview

This C++ program defines a function calSpecial which determines if a given number can be represented as the sum of consecutive positive integers starting from 1. If the number can be represented in this way, it prints the sequence of numbers and marks it as a "Special number". Otherwise, it prints "Not a special number."

Functionality

Input: An integer entered by the user.
Output: A message indicating whether the number is a "Special number" or not, and if it is special, it prints the sequence of numbers that sum to the given number.
Code Description

calSpecial(int val, int &counter, int &sum): A recursive function that:
Checks if the current sum equals the input value val. If true, it prints the sequence of numbers leading to that sum and resets the sum and counter.
Checks if the sum exceeds the input value val. If true, it prints "Not a special number."
If neither of the above conditions is met, it adds the current counter value to the sum and increments the counter, then recursively calls itself.
main():
Prompts the user to input an integer.
Initializes counter and sum to 1 and 0, respectively.
Calls calSpecial with the user-provided integer and the initialized counter and sum.
