This C++ code checks if a given number is a "special number" based on a specific criteria. Here's a detailed breakdown of what each part of the code does:

Code Breakdown
Function Definition: calSpecial(int val, int &counter, int &sum)
Parameters:
val: The target value to check.
counter: Keeps track of the current number in the sequence.
sum: The running total of the sequence.
Functionality:
Base Case 1: If sum equals val, the function prints "Special number" and displays the sequence of numbers that add up to val.
It resets sum to 0 and starts a new sequence from counter to reach val.
Base Case 2: If sum exceeds val, the function prints "Not a special number" and terminates.
Recursive Case: If sum is less than val, the function adds the current counter value to sum, increments counter, and calls itself recursively with updated values.
Main Function: int main()
Prompts the user to enter a number (x).
Initializes counter to 1 and sum to 0.
Calls the calSpecial function with the entered number, counter, and sum.
Example
If you input 6, the function will:

Start with counter = 1 and sum = 0.
Add 1 to sum, making sum = 1, and increment counter to 2.
Add 2 to sum, making sum = 3, and increment counter to 3.
Add 3 to sum, making sum = 6, which matches val.
At this point:

It prints "Special number".
Displays the sequence: 1 + 2 + 3 (which adds up to 6).
