Overview

This C++ program checks if a given number can be represented as the sum of consecutive positive integers starting from 1. If the number is a special number (i.e., it can be expressed as such a sum), the program will output a sequence of additions that equal the number. If not, it will indicate that the number is not special.

How It Works

Input: The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
Processing: The calSpecial function recursively calculates whether the given number can be represented as a sum of consecutive integers starting from 1.
Output:
If the number can be expressed as such a sum, it prints "Special number" followed by the sequence of additions.
If the number cannot be expressed as such a sum, it prints "Not a special number."
Functions

void calSpecial(int val, int &counter, int &sum)
Parameters:
val (int): The number to be checked.
counter (int&): Keeps track of the current integer being added.
sum (int&): Keeps track of the cumulative sum of integers.
Description:
Checks if the current sum equals the given number. If so, prints the sequence.
If the sum exceeds the number, indicates that it is not a special number.
Uses recursion to add consecutive integers and update the sum.
int main()
Description:
Prompts the user for input.
Initializes variables and calls calSpecial to perform the calculation.

Example

mathematica
Copy code
Enter Number= 
15
Special number
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
In this example, 15 is a special number because it can be represented as the sum of the first five consecutive positive integers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5).

Notes

The program uses recursion to determine if the number can be represented as a sum of consecutive integers.
If the input number is less than 1, the output will be "Not a special number" as the sum of positive integers starting from 1 cannot be negative or zero.
